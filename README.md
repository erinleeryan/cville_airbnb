Work on mapping all the locations of Cville Air BnB's from their website

## Why?
Because I can. Also because it would be handy for folks in the city to have a listing and mapping of those places listed on AirBnB to compare to the licenses to see who is trying to skirt the law

## How?
Well I can't quite tell you that because a) the hope is this will be community sourced in part and b) I don't want to actually tell people listing stuff without a license how they're being stupid. Except that one dude: seriously, pay your photographer, screenshots of her proofs with all your browser tabs so you don't have to "buy" the photos is just tacky bro. I hope she learns to watermark the heck out of things.
